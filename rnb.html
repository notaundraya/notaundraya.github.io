            <h2>What's R&B?</h2>
            <p>
                Rhythm and Blues or R&B music, was originally termed "race music" and basically included anything intended for African-American audiences. A combination of jazz, gospel, and blues, the term "R&B" was coined in the late 1940s in the United States for use as a less offensive marketing term.

            <p>
                While R&B music has evolved over the years to spawn contemporary sounds, the original genre focused on "boogie" rhythms and included such famous acts as Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry. The end of World War II produced a surprising call for new sounds, and the R&B music genre took off as a result.

            <blockquote>
              “I feel like R&B is really based off of emotion and truth. R&B is a conversation.”  <br> - Sevyn Streeter;

            <h2>Why R&B?</h2>
            <p>
                As well as giving you a buzz, R&B is also capable of uplifting your spirits and improving your mood. Many of the lyrics found in R&B music talk about overcoming a struggle and succeeding. Whether it is being out of money or just going through a difficult time, the artists can often relay their own difficult narratives and show that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Some people may stick on a sad song when feeling down others turn to R&B music.
