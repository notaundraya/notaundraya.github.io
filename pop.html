            <h2>What's Pop?</h2>
            <p>
                Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom. The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many disparate styles. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. Rock and pop music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.

                Although much of the music that appears on record charts is considered to be pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music. Identifying factors usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse–chorus structure), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to. Much pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as rock, urban, dance, Latin, and country.

            <blockquote>
              “Pop music has greater power to change people and to affect people because it's a universal language. You don't have to understand music to understand the power of a pop song.”  <br>- Paul Epworth;
            </blockquote>
            <h2>Why Pop?</h2>
            <p>
                Another thing that makes pop music so great is that it’s usually very upbeat and joyful. With its high energy and positive vibe, pop music can help you feel happier regardless of what you’re going through or how you’re feeling. Whether it’s a catchy song about love or a party anthem perfect for dancing along to, pop music has the ability to lift your spirits and make you smile.
