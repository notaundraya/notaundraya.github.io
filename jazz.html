            <h2>What's Jazz?</h2>
            <p>
              Jazz is a kind of music in which improvisation is typically an important part. In most jazz performances, players play solos which they make up on the spot, which requires considerable skill. There is tremendous variety in jazz, but most jazz is very rhythmic, has a forward momentum called "swing," and uses "bent" or "blue" notes. You can often hear "call--and--response" patterns in jazz, in which one instrument, voice, or part of the band answers another.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jazz can express many different emotions, from pain to sheer joy. In jazz, you may hear the sounds of freedom-for the music has been a powerful voice for people suffering unfair treatment because of the color of the skin, or because they lived in a country run by a cruel dictator.

            <h2>Why Jazz?</h2>
            <p>
              Jazz music relaxes the body by activating your alpha brain waves, which helps with reducing anxiety and promoting a calm mind. Listening to jazz music can activate delta brain waves, which induces better sleep. In addition to alpha and delta waves, jazz music can promote your theta brain waves, which encourage higher levels of creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to a study conducted by Johns Hopkins University, listening to jazz can improve your memory, mood, and verbal abilities. Studies show that those who listen to jazz or slow music are 25% less likely to develop depression. Whether you’re listening to the same songs or new musicians every night, exposing your brain to jazz music is a great way to improve your overall mental well-being.
